 ## Constitution Check
 
 *GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*
 
-[Gates determined based on constitution file]
+1. **Self-Describing Code (C- Floor)** — Plan must show how modules stay readable without inline
+   commentary (naming conventions, pure functions, docstrings only when essential) and cite the
+   static-analysis tool that will enforce a ≥ C- maintainability grade before merge.
+2. **Zero-Fault Data Pipeline** — Every ingestion/transform/export stage needs automated schema
+   validation, duplicate detection, and idempotent retries; include a dry-run proof that no data
+   loss can occur before production inputs are touched.
+3. **High-Fidelity OCR Backbone** — Define the OCR dataset, baseline accuracy targets (≥98% character
+   or ≥95% word accuracy), benchmarking cadence, and rollback criteria for regressions.
+4. **Instrumented Integrity** — Specify telemetry, logging, and alert thresholds that guarantee the
+   pipeline remains deterministic, plus the exact signals that will halt deployments when violated.
+5. **Lean Dependency Discipline** — List every new library with rationale and removal plan; reject
+   "just-in-case" dependencies that do not directly improve OCR accuracy or pipeline stability.

+# Starbucks Crawling Constitution
+
+## Core Principles
+
+### Self-Describing Code (C- Floor)
+- Inline comments exist only for hard invariants or regulatory callouts; target ≤2% comment density by
+  keeping functions short, pure, and named after their intent.
+- Every merge must include a static-analysis or maintainability report that scores the touched files
+  at C- or better; failing scores block release until refactored.
+- Public APIs document behavior via docstrings; implementation details explain themselves through
+  structure, tests, and naming rather than explanatory prose.
+Rationale: Minimal commentary is viable only when the codebase is self-explanatory; enforcing a
+maintainability floor prevents the pipeline from devolving into opaque scripts that jeopardize data
+trust.
+
+### Zero-Fault Data Pipeline
+- Each ingestion, transform, and export stage MUST perform schema validation, duplicate detection,
+  and checksum-based reconciliation before marking a batch complete.
+- Pipelines run deterministically: jobs are idempotent, retries are explicit, and any warning is
+  treated as a failure until investigated.
+- Golden-path integration tests replicate real crawls/OCR runs and must pass in CI before new data
+  connectors or transformations reach production.
+Rationale: The crawler exists to deliver clean data; tolerating even a single silent failure negates
+the project’s value.
+
+### High-Fidelity OCR Backbone
+- OCR components target ≥98% character accuracy or ≥95% word accuracy on the curated Starbucks data
+  corpus; deviations >0.5% trigger automatic rollback.
+- Maintain a labeled benchmark dataset, update it when source layouts shift, and record every test
+  run to prove historical accuracy trends.
+- Libraries that materially improve OCR quality are allowed, but only after benchmarking proves the
+  uplift relative to the current stack.
+Rationale: Data integrity hinges on OCR precision; without a measurable floor and regression history,
+downstream analytics cannot be trusted.
+
+### Instrumented Integrity
+- All pipeline stages emit structured logs, metrics, and alerts that tie each record back to its OCR
+  snapshot and transformation path.
+- Reproducible dry runs (with seeded input) are required before production deployments; artifacts and
+  run IDs are archived for audits.
+- Alert thresholds map directly to escalation steps (pause crawl, roll back OCR model, reprocess
+  data) and must be documented in runbooks.
+Rationale: Observability is the only way to guarantee “no issues” in the data pipeline and to diagnose
+any drift before users do.
+
+### Lean Dependency Discipline
+- Introduce a new library only when it demonstrably improves OCR accuracy or pipeline stability; the
+  justification and evaluation notes live alongside the dependency declaration.
+- Every dependency has an exit plan (version pinning, replacement, or removal) reviewed at least once
+  per quarter.
+- Favor standard library + existing stack first; experimental packages run in isolated spikes before
+  touching production code.
+Rationale: Unnecessary libraries bloat attack surface, slow audits, and obscure the performance gains
+we need for OCR.
+
+## Data & OCR Performance Standards
+- Maintain up-to-date documentation of the entire data flow (crawl → OCR → normalization → export),
+  including schema contracts, invariants, and validation scripts per stage.
+- Benchmark OCR weekly (or after each model/config change) against the golden dataset; store reports,
+  confusion matrices, and false-positive/negative samples for traceability.
+- Define acceptable latency and throughput for pipeline stages so performance optimizations do not
+  compromise accuracy; publish these targets with every feature plan.
+- Treat reconciliation reports and anomaly dashboards as release artifacts—no deployment is complete
+  without attaching them to the change log.
+
+## Development Workflow & Quality Gates
+- Design docs (specs, plans, tasks) must explicitly record how each principle is satisfied; work
+  cannot start while a gate is ambiguous.
+- CI runs readability checks, schema/duplication tests, OCR benchmarks, and dependency audits on
+  every PR; failures block merges without exception.
+- Code reviews certify that added dependencies were justified, that metrics/logging coverage grew
+  with new functionality, and that recoverability steps are documented.
+- Releases include a dry-run report, OCR accuracy summary, and dependency delta; operations receives
+  these artifacts before deployment approval.
+
+## Governance
+- This constitution supersedes conflicting guidance; exceptions require a written RFC describing the
+  risk, mitigation, and rollback plan approved by the project maintainer.
+- Amendments follow Semantic Versioning: MAJOR for removing/replacing principles, MINOR for adding
+  principles/sections or materially expanding requirements, PATCH for clarifications and typo fixes.
+- Ratification history is immutable; new amendments append to the change log with supporting evidence
+  (benchmarks, audits) stored in the repo.
+- Compliance is reviewed every iteration: specs/plans are checked up front, CI enforces gates during
+  development, and quarterly audits verify dependency hygiene + OCR accuracy trends.
